# Guess my value game
This script will scrape needed data, and then the program logic use these data, allowing you to guess values of football players from Slovak first football tier: Nik√© liga.

## Desktop application that I used for coding part
```
PyCharm
```

## Used libraries and modules
```
import requests
BeautifulSoup
pandas
random
time
```

## App idea:
```
My inspiration was https://www.transfermarkt.com/whatsMyValue, but unfortunately the Slovak league is not included, so therefore I tried to create similar app/ game with Python.
```
